I would like to create a system that creates 3D scenes by utilizing vision-language models and agentic AI workflows. Tentatively, here is my design plan:
1) A human-readable plain text representation will serve as the data representation of scene definition. (This likely has to be a structured language format. I am split between different options, but YAML is a very strong contender.)
2) Given diverse combinations of high-level inputs (like scene category, characteristics, and design intentions), AI agents first scaffold into a rich description (one could call it a plan), and tackle the task in multiple steps.
3) 3D scene generation process seems similar to code compilation in that they are hierarchical processes that first start from high-level information and gradually "lowers" the representation, adding more details and concreteness along the way. I think it is quite logic to divide the task into:
  3A) First creating a simple metadata of the scene, that consists of scene category (one possible way is to have a manually defined categories: "residential", "education", "commerce", ...) as well as *tags* that add composable adjectives. We could have utility fields to simplify things (like distinguishing single-floor vs. multi-floor scenes), etc.
  3B) Planning the scene: the main modality of this will be in text as described in (2), but it's possible to utilize different technologies like image generation models for inspiration.
  3C) Creating a floor plan, which defines the layout of rooms, hallways, and sections of buildings with respect to each other. I'm not quite sure what to use as the representation of this... hmm. The floor plan would include not only the location but assign each room a similar set of metadata (category, tags, utility fields).
  3D) Designing the room! The way I'm imagining this process to be is, we will give LLMs/VLMs function-calling capabilities and let them build the room. We can have "add" actions (which may use a flexible set of parameters that may include position, possibly orientation, possibly a relation with another object), "edit" actions to move, rotate, or scale objects, maybe "pattern" actions that let them quickly make an array of things, etc. We will give them the ability to "preview" any of these actions by visually observing what the scene would look like if they were to perform this action (please add a global configuration variable that toggle this behavior), etc.
  3E) That basically seems like it! We can add validation logic to make sure they are *proper* rooms, like there's nothing blocking doors from opening, etc.
4) Some more implementation details: we will use 3D object databases (like Objaverse or COCO3D), as well as utilizing 3D asset generation models that are capable of creating something that fits the text description. Let's use Blender to hold the actual scene. (Remember we will use plain text / YAML as the scene definition? The plan is that we make it possible to turn that scene definition into a real 3D model in Blender.)
  4A) Let's use `langgraph` to define the agentic AI workflows. Please look at `langgraph` documentation (via context7) when implementing.
5) Let's package this as an installable Python library, and use the modern best practices (hatchling, pyproject.toml, etc.)

Please provide a great architecture for this system!

This is a fantastic foundation. The documentation for `langgraph` confirms that it's an excellent choice for orchestrating the kind of complex, stateful, and hierarchical workflow you've described. The concepts of `State`, `Nodes`, and `Edges` map directly to the steps you've outlined.

Based on your plan and the `langgraph` documentation, I've designed a high-level architecture for the system.

### Proposed System Architecture

The system will be a modular Python library, `scene_builder`, with a clear separation of concerns. The core logic will be orchestrated by a `langgraph` workflow that manages the entire scene generation process, from initial concept to the final, detailed definition.

Here is a visual representation of the proposed agentic workflow:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Scene Generation Workflow"
        direction LR
        A[Start: High-Level Input] --> B(1. Metadata Agent);
        B --> C(2. Scene Planning Agent);
        C --> D(3. Floor Plan Agent);
        D --> E(4. Room Design Agent);
        E --> F(5. Validation Agent);
        F --> G[End: Scene Definition];
    end

    subgraph "Room Design Subgraph (Agent)"
        direction TB
        E1(Add/Edit/Pattern Object) --> E2{Preview Enabled?};
        E2 -- Yes --> E3[Generate Visual Preview];
        E3 --> E4{Continue Designing?};
        E2 -- No --> E4;
        E4 -- Yes --> E1;
        E4 -- No --> E_End(Finalize Room);
    end

    E -- Contains --> E1;

    G --> H((Blender Importer));
    H --> I([Blender 3D Scene]);

```

### Core Components

1. **Scene Definition (`/scene_builder/definition`):**
    * This directory will contain the data schemas for our scene using YAML format. We'll define structures for `Scene`, `Room`, `Object`, `FloorPlan`, etc. This creates a strongly-typed, human-readable foundation for our scene data.

2. **Agentic Workflow (`/scene_builder/workflows`):**
    * This is the heart of the system, built with `langgraph`.
    * **`MainState`:** A central `TypedDict` will manage the state of the entire generation process, holding the scene definition as it's progressively built by the agents.
    * **Nodes (Agents):** Each step in your plan (3A-3E) will be a `Node` in our `StateGraph`. For example, the `MetadataAgent`, `PlanningAgent`, etc.
    * **Edges:** Conditional logic will connect the nodes. For instance, an edge after the `FloorPlanAgent` could loop over each created room and invoke the `RoomDesignAgent` for each one.
    * **`RoomDesignAgent` (Subgraph):** The room design process itself is a complex workflow. We'll encapsulate it in its own `StateGraph` (a subgraph) with nodes for adding objects, editing them, and optionally calling a tool to generate a visual preview in Blender.

3. **Tools (`/scene_builder/tools`):**
    * These are the function-calling capabilities provided to the LLM agents. This will include functions for:
        * Querying 3D object databases (`Objaverse`, etc.).
        * Invoking 3D asset generation models.
        * Interacting with a background Blender process for the "preview" feature.

4. **Blender Importer (`/scene_builder/importers`):**
    * A standalone module responsible for parsing the final YAML scene definition and using the Blender Python API (`bpy`) to construct the actual 3D scene.

5. **Packaging (`pyproject.toml`):**
    * The entire system will be packaged as an installable Python library using modern standards like `pyproject.toml` and `hatchling`, making it easy to distribute and use.

I will now create a detailed, step-by-step plan to build this system.

✦ I've updated scene_builder/importers/objaverse_importer.py with a search_and_import_object function for semantic
  searching. It leverages Objaverse's LVIS annotations to find and download objects based on your text query, like "red
  sofa." The main execution block now demonstrates this new functionality. Any questions?

✦ The search results show objaverse.load_lvis_annotations() returns a dictionary of LVIS categories and UIDs. My previous
  code failed because I was iterating incorrectly. The new plan is to load annotations, iterate through the keys (category
  names), and if the query is in the category, extend a list with the corresponding UIDs. I will now correct the code in
  scene_builder/importers/objaverse_importer.py.

│  > @scene_builder/ What parts of my code are still preliminary?  │
╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

✦ Based on the code you've provided, here are the parts of your project that appear to be preliminary or not yet fully implemented:

  1. Object Creation in blender_decoder.py

  The _create_object function currently has a fallback to creating a simple cube as a placeholder if the object import from Objaverse fails. This is a good temporary measure, but a more robust implementation would handle this more gracefully, perhaps
  with more sophisticated placeholders or better error handling.

  2. test_importer.py

  This file seems to be a work in progress. The search_and_import_object function is missing a definition for the annotations variable, which would cause an error if run as is. It appears to be an incomplete copy or alternative version of
  objaverse_importer.py.

  3. Mock Data in object_database.py

  The query_object_database function is a simulation. It returns hardcoded mock data for "sofa" and "table" queries. A full implementation would require connecting to and querying a real database like Objaverse.

  4. Non-Debug Mode in RoomDesignAgent

  In scene_builder/workflow/graph.py, the RoomDesignAgent has a placeholder for non-debug mode. Currently, it prints a message saying "LLM call not implemented" and doesn't actually add any objects to the room. This is a key area for future
  development.

  5. Hardcoded Scene Plan and Floor Plan

  In scene_builder/workflow/graph.py:

* BuildingPlanAgent uses a hardcoded plan: "1. Create a living room.\n2. Add a sofa.".
* FloorPlanAgent creates a single, hardcoded "living_room_1".

  A more advanced version would generate these dynamically based on user input or more complex logic.

  In summary, the core workflow graph is in place, but the key agents and data sources are using placeholders and mock data. The next steps for this project would likely involve replacing these preliminary parts with fully functional implementations.

│  > What is the relationship between objaverse_importer and object_database?  │
╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

✦ Excellent question. It highlights a key architectural pattern in your application: the separation of concerns between discovery and retrieval.

  Here’s a breakdown of the relationship:

   1. `ObjectDatabase` is the "Catalog" (Discovery):
       * Purpose: Its job is to search for metadata about objects. It answers the question, "What objects match the description 'a modern sofa'?"
       * Input: A semantic text query (e.g., "a chair", "wooden table").
       * Output: A list of dictionaries containing information about the objects (like their id, name, description, source). It does not download the actual 3D model files.

   2. `objaverse_importer` is the "Downloader" (Retrieval):
       * Purpose: Its job is to download the actual 3D model file for a specific, known object. It answers the question, "Please fetch the 3D model for the object with the ID '000074a334c541878360457c672b6c2e'."
       * Input: A unique object identifier (object_uid).
       * Output: The local filepath to the downloaded .glb file (e.g., /tmp/some_dir/000074a334c541878360457c672b6c2e.glb).

  The Workflow: How They Work Together

  The two modules are used in sequence to place an object in the scene:

   1. Search: An agent (like RoomDesignAgent) uses ObjectDatabase.query() to find objects that fit a description.
   2. Select: The agent receives a list of potential objects and selects one. The most important piece of information it gets is the object's source_id.
   3. Store: This source_id is stored in the Scene definition. At this point, no 3D model has been downloaded yet; you've only saved a reference to it.
   4. Import: When it's time to build the scene in Blender, the blender_decoder reads the Scene definition. For each object, it takes the source_id and passes it to objaverse_importer.import_object().
   5. Decode: The objaverse_importer downloads the file and returns the local path, which blender_decoder then uses to import the model into the Blender scene.

  This separation makes your system more efficient. You don't waste time and bandwidth downloading objects until you are sure you need them for the final scene.

╭──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│  > Do you think `tools` is the right folder where `object_databse` belongs?  │
╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

✦ That's a great architectural question. It gets to the heart of how to organize a project for clarity and scalability.

  For your current, agent-based architecture, the tools folder is a very fitting and descriptive name.

  Here’s the reasoning:

   1. Agent-Centric Design: Your workflow is built around LLM agents (RoomDesignAgent, BuildingPlanAgent). In the context of agentic AI, a "tool" is a specific function or capability that the agent can decide to use to interact with the outside world.
      Your ObjectDatabase.query() function is exactly that—it's a tool the RoomDesignAgent uses to get information it needs to complete its task.
   2. Clear Intent: The name tools immediately signals to anyone reading the code that the modules inside are meant to be used by the agents in the workflow directory. It clearly separates the "thinkers" (agents) from the "doers" (tools).

  Alternative Structures and When to Use Them

  While tools is a good choice now, as a project grows, other naming conventions might become more appropriate. Here are some common alternatives and their philosophies:

* `services/`: This is a very strong alternative. In this pattern, ObjectDatabase would be considered an ObjectQueryService. A "service" provides a distinct business capability (like querying objects, handling payments, etc.). This name is more
     generic than tools and is an excellent choice if you imagine other, non-agent parts of your application needing to access the object database in the future.

* `adapters/` or `connectors/`: This comes from patterns like Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters). An "adapter" is a piece of code that connects your application's core logic to an external system. ObjectDatabase is a perfect example of an
     adapter, as it connects your scene builder to the Objaverse API. This name emphasizes that the module is a "boundary" object that talks to the outside world.

* `data/`: This is another possibility, often used to house data access layers (Data Access Objects, repositories, etc.). It's a good, generic name for anything related to data persistence or retrieval.

  Verdict and Recommendation

* For Now: Stick with tools. It accurately reflects the current architecture where the database query is a tool for an LLM agent. It's idiomatic and clear.
* For the Future: If you find that more and more non-agent components start using ObjectDatabase, or if you add more modules that provide core business logic, consider renaming the tools folder to services. This would be a logical refactoring step as
     the application's architecture evolves.

  You've correctly identified a key architectural component. For now, the name is well-chosen, but it's smart to keep these alternatives in mind.

  Would you like me to rename the folder now, or are you happy with the current structure?
