ROOM_DESIGN_AGENT_PROMPT = (
    "You are a supervisor who is part of a building interior design system.",
    "You will be given various tasks relating to designing the 3D indoor environment of a room.",
    "Please complete them with the intention of creating a cohesive, functional, and attractive, interior environment.",  # NOTE: maybe add "realistic"?
    # "Images: You may be given paths to image files. You are equipped with a `read_media_file` tool to view them.",
    # "If you are given paths to image files, please try to view relevant image before answering.**",
)
# NOTE: Some of the relevant/possible tasks: 
# - shopping
# - placement
# - inspection (requesting visual feedback from specific viewpoint)
# - exploration (generation and coalescing of different options for comparison)

# IDEA: `request_to_shopping_agent()`, `requst_to_placement_agent()`

# IDEA: In the video visualization, the cute mini drones will show chat bubbles,
#       the shopping agent will look thru object database (scrolling thru 3D shapes) and send 3d objects to shopping cart (visible) in a cute ease-in-out animation,
#       the building agent will receive items from shopping cart and place them (by approaching and placing physically). 
#       The "turn" and exchange of information (such as visualfeedback) will be conveyed visually — the drone will receive a photo, for example.

# NOTE: The PlacementAgent - VisualFeedback loop does NOT require the use of graphs. 
#       Simplistically, the reason is: because the call stack does not involve 'GOTO' (to arbitrary) logic. It's a simple loop.

# NOTE: The one-of-many (one PlacementAgent placing multiple objects at once) or many-of-one (spawning multiple PlacementAgent that each places one object) dilemma must be at least thought upon, maybe experimented (ablated).

# NOTE (yunho-c): It helps to visually imagine a bunch of flying mini-robots looking at a room, designing/building it together.
# 돈 필요하면 OpenAI랑 구글에 돈 달라 하자. 인터뷰 부탁해서, 내가 이거때문에 API 엄청 필요한데 제발 도와달라고. (OpenAI는 신청 프로그램도 있었잖아 !)
# NOTE: The good thing with sub-agents is that they can be parallelized — massively. (Honestly, placing multiple objects in parallel with dependency calc & log/monitoring window is SO exciting.)
# NOTE: The good thing with "do-it-yourself" (one agent with single converation history) doing everything sequentially is that context mgmt (not losing info on the way) is easy.
#       Humans do everything themselves (an interior designer uses requirements, imagination, browser tabs for shopping, 3D CAD for placing) sequentially. 

# NOTE: Whether more context is better (~ sequential) or less context is better (~ parallel) is something that can be experimented (ablated) ourselves, which is great.

# NOTE: NOT EVERYTHING HAS TO BE A GRAPH.

# NOTE: Can do inter-object dependency calculation, and select top-level objects. And LLM can further filter out what to target for the current turn.
# NOTE: Single vs. multi-object placement (one PlacementAgent call taking care of multiple placeables being placed onto room) must be experimented. 

# NOTE: The `previous state` tracking must be done at the LLM conversation level, not at the state level (at least we should prevent from n-ly repeating every past history per turn - like the area of a triangle).

ROOM_DESIGN_AGENT_PROMPT_OLD = (
    "You are a room designer.",

# NOTE: The difference in the two prompts (new and old) represent a shift in the conceptualization of
#       the multi-agent interaction system. The 'old' prompt (*) imagined either a single "agent" (a LLM conversation
#       with coherent chronology) either directly utilizing different tools (such as `ShoppingCart`) or directly
#       interacting with agents (such as `PlacementAgent`), e.g., directly invoking them with specific inputs. 
#       The 'new' prompt imagines an explicitization such workflows (or invoking ShoppingCart and PlacementAgent) via
#       explicit medium of communication (text messages) that will be passed to the sub-agents (`shopping_agent`, `placement_agent`).

#       Something to note is that, if the conversation is cut at a certain point (e.g., the room_design_agent != room_planning_agent),
#       the LLM may lose the latent activations that generated their original answers. For example, (TODO).
#       So, I think it is impmortant to try to feed the previous messages (such as plans) into the context as "agent" messages.
